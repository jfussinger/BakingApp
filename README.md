# BakingApp

### Overview

In this project, you will create an app to view video recipes. You will handle media loading, verify your user interfaces with UI tests, and integrate third party libraries. You'll also provide a complete user experience with a home screen widget.

### Project Rubric

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity Code Reviewer according to this rubric. (https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/829/view)

### Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

### What Will I Learn?
In this project you will:

Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos, handle error cases in Android, add a widget to your app experience, leverage a third-party library in your app, use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets, app Description.

Your task is to create a Android Baking App that will allow Udacityâ€™s resident baker-in-chief, Miriam, to share her recipes with the world. You will create an app that will allow a user to select a recipe and see video-guided steps for how to complete it.
